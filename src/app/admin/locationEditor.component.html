<!--
Angular will provide an ActivatedRoute object as a constructor argument when it creates a new instance
of the component class and that can be used to inspect the activated route. In this case, the component works
out whether it should be editing or creating a product and, if editing, retrieves the current details from the
repository. There is also a save method, which uses the repository to save changes that the user has made.
To provide the component with a template, I added a file called productEditor.component.html in the
SportsStore/src/app/admin folder and added the markup shown in Listing 9-26

The template contains a form with fields for the properties defined by the Product model class, with the
exception of the id property, which is assigned automatically by the RESTful web service.

The elements in the form adapt their appearance to differentiate between the editing and creating
features. To see how the component works, authenticate to access the Admin features and click the Create
New Product button that appears under the table of products. Fill out the form, click the Create button,
and the new product will be sent to the RESTful web service where it will be assigned an ID property and
displayed in the product table, as shown in FigureÂ 9-5.
